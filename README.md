# [Blog Site](https://blog-site-next-js-six.vercel.app)
###
The `Blog Site` homepage features multiple blog cards, each displaying a blog title and a `View Details` button. Users can click either the title or the button to be redirected to a `dynamic blog page`, showcasing detailed content for each blog.

The website also includes a `profile page`, accessible exclusively to logged-in users, adding a layer of personalization and security. For authentication, I utilized `Kinde`, ensuring secure login functionality and restricted access to protected routes.
